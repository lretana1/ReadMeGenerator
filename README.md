  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This project allows the user to quickly generate a ReadMe file without having to manually type out the whole process.

  One of the issues that arises with often of projects is that the readme is often ignored or not given enough attention. One of the most important parts of any project is allowing the user to get a glipse or small summary of what to expect from it.

  This generator will allow the user to answer a series of prompts that will automatically become the body of the ReadMe file without the user having to manually create one everytime thereby saving them time. This in turn allows the project the ability to appear much more neat and proffesional which makes it much easier to navigate and increase its likelihood of being chosen over similar apps.

  

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  Below I have provided a download link to hte project for ease of access. The file may either be cloned down to a particular directory or a zip version of the project is also made available. Next you'll want to open up the file through a text editor for the next step. Move into the root directory of the project "ReadMeGenerator". All the prerequisites have been been met are youre just about ready to open the app.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  If you have done everything asked of you in the installation part of the guide, next youll want to type ‘node index.js’ in the terminal. Once all the answers have been answered correctyl the terminal will let list the questions with the response given for each along with a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file under the ‘develop’ folder called ‘generatedREADME’. Because the newly created ReadMe is generated in markdown its as simple as copying and pasting the file anywhere it is required.
